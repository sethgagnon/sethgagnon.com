<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span>

I have over 12 years experience mainly in the healthcare industry and have worked with various middleware technologies (mostly IBM based) from business process management technology to automate member enrollment, claim adjudication, and other key healthcare business functions. I have experience in IBM middleware products such as WebSphere Application Server, WebSphere Process Server, WebSphere Business Process Manager, and other products in the IBM BPM stack.

I also have experience with other middleware technologies like Redhat JBoss Fuse, Redhat JBoss EAP, and Pega PRPC, to name a few . I have experience with DevOps practices to incorporate Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery into solutions.
