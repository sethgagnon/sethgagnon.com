The new version of IBM BPM was released within the last month or so.  Overall, it seems as though the majority of the new features focus around a redesigned Process Portal, along with some integration to content management systems.  Some other highlights that may be overlooked include:

  1. Installation now includes the installation of the IBM Support Assistant Data Collector to help with problem determination and even opening a service request,
  2. A new compare and copy feature in Process Center will allow you to better manage your changing process applications,
  3. Searching capabilities in Process Center,
  4. Introduction of Coach Views in Process Designer &#8211; reusable user interfaces that you can create and customize,
  5. Improved error handling with Advanced Integration Services
