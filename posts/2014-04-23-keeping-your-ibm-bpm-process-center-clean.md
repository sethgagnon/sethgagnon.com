In order to keep your Process Center environment clean and running optimally, you need to perform some routine actions at a minimum of a **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">weekly basis</span>**:

  1. Terminate and delete all unnecessary process instances for all apps
  2. Archive any Process Application snapshots that are no longer needed
  3. Archive any Toolkit snapshots that are no longer needed
  4. Archive any Process Applications that are no longer needed
  5. Archive any Toolkits that are no longer needed
  6. After you archive the Process Applications, please remove any that are no longer needed from the archive
  7. After you archive the Toolkits, please remove any that are no longer needed from the archive
  8. Uninstall any SCA components that are no longer needed (from the WAS console)
  9. Delete any failed events from Failed Event Manager that are no longer needed
